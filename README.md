# Chatbot Using Generators and Transmitters

This project implements a simple **real-time chatbot** using **Python generators** and **transmitter functions** to handle dialogue flow. The chatbot is structured to process user inputs and respond accordingly in an interactive manner.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

- `real_time.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating the chatbot logic using Python generators.
- Example dialogue flow and explanations included within the notebook.

## üß† Key Concepts

- **Generators**: Used to maintain conversational state.
- **Transmitter Functions**: Functions that transmit messages between user input and bot logic, allowing modular design.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: The bot processes inputs as they are provided, simulating a real-time conversation.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kakshayasailu/chat-bot-by-generators-and-transmitters.git
   cd chat-bot-by-generators-and-transmitters

 **example usage**
User: Hi
Bot: Hello! How can I help you today?

User: Tell me a joke
Bot: Why did the computer go to therapy? Because it had a hard drive!
